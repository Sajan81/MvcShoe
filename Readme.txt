My name is gursagar i got an assignment from one of my very charming proffeser Andrew Steele And in my assignmennt i have to made it on 
the subject of shoe

part 1
So i have installed the visual studio 2019 but ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, somehow i got erorr then ingot an idea that my proffesor is 
so smart he have provided to me to download it from college access website ,then tried it and it worked  so now the pain in my headache 
was the 3.1 dotnet web  but it was not over there so i decided to download it first and but thee error was over theree  ,,,,,oh shit !
but i am the son of genius       so i deleted it and tried it again and this time  ........ you know whatt i mean ... it worked ......
Hurreeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyy!
So  i created my web app now it is time to test it run it and i tried but    

it is like i don't want you (just kidding) it did not run and showing error 
So as you know i am smart so i opened launchsetting.json and commented ssl line and guess what it again not showing errror you know 
noooooo 
it worked 

part 2 
in part 2 i added  a controller in  controllers foldeer and than i took a code and pasted and edited it thereafter i run it and it worked 
by changing url like entering, helloWorld, Welcome and try to run it and it was showing my result like Hello World and so on 
there after as in the tutorial shown thst i have to change some of the code for the welcome like i have to made changes like numTimes
so to complete that step i made changes in the welcome query in HelloWorldController.cs File , after making the changes when i try to run it it worked like as showed in the 
tutorial
so now the moment of truth is that i have to move to third part just kidding after completing all the steps i am ready to move to part-3

part3

In the begining of part 3 in HelloWorldCntrolller.cs file i have uppdated the index part, after this pRT I ADDED new folder known as HelloWorld under which i created index.cshtml file,
moving to next part that is of updating index file by the code related to index of project and so far it is working without any pain in A....
In the layout.cshtml i changed the name from MvcShoe to Sniper's Shoes and saved it, changed the naem of my indx from MvcShoe to MySniper Shoe List
So important thing here is the Passing data from the controller . so at many time i entered the number it will gonna print name as same as numbers.

thereafter i created the welcome.cshtml under views and uploade the coding from tutorial and i tried to run it and gues what huuuuuhhaahaahhahhahhah it worked yessss!.
and by this i have completed my part 3 thank godd

part4 

in the part 4 ihave to enter the specifications of my app products so i entered 6 main thingd and 
major part of this is that ihaev to run the query  to test the link  in nuggetpackage manager but when i tried it 
it was like (what the hell bro ' who are you ) it was showing a big ducking error so as my smarty professor said i have downloaded the exact entity framework and run it on 3.1 
server and after installing it 
it was like  a moment of truth 
it worked buraahhhhhh
then i added data folder containing MvcShoeContext.cs and  in that file there i face a error i try to fix it but it was difficult then i did it agin and again after some tries i tried and it somehow work but i dont know how 

then i left that point and moved ahead after this step i addedtwo lines of coding in statrup.cs
after this part i added configure file in my STARTUP.CS file and saved it 
to update my database i have to add some of the code in appsetting.json so i opened it and completed it by adding in tit 
it was like an hour as i was facing a big problem i got the big problem i got error in adding controller as i have to scaffold all the things then i tried a lot i did a lot things but didnt
work than i loked on my bullshit
that i have created two startup.csfiles there after i delted it and runn it it worked
Againnnnn i got error i am frustrated now 
now when i try to open the database it is not opening i am again dtryin trying but nothing coming in my hand 
after a lot of hard work but it didn't work thani make a call to my friend and asked about it and he told me to change the layout.cshtml (csprocessor) and change home into Shoes and try to run it 
but somehow it worked and i was like i need Corona today
part 4 completed where is my champaigan
